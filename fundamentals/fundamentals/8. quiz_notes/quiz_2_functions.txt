1. How do you declare a function in Python?
- def function_name():

2. Functions should ALWAYS return a value:
- False. Return values are optional.

3. True or False: A function call is equal to whatever that function returns.
- True a return value is the value that remains after the functions block of code has completed.

4. What is a function?
- b, c, and d: a block of code designed to execute a specific task, function can be said to take in raw materials and return a finished product, and should be used any time a set of code is to be reused.

5. What is the difference between a parameter and argument?
- a and d: an argument is passed in when a function is called.

6. Why use a function?
- a and b: we can reuse code and we can try to improve clarity by modularizing code for individual repeatable tasks.
