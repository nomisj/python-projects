- A block of code that we can run at any point of time.
- Can be defined and called anywhere in the file.

- Think of a function as a recipe. If we were preparing a meal we would:
    1. Specify ingredients (variables) needed for the meal.
    2. Use the actual ingredients (pass arguments) when starting (invoke a function).
    3. We follow the instructions step by step (function) for ingredients (parameters) and prepare them.
    4. Once the food is ready we serve it up to those that are eating. (return)

- The advantages of functions are reducing the duplication of code, breaking down complex problems into simpler pieces, and improving clarity of code.
