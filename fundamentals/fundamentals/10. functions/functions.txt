- A block of code that we can run at any point of time.
- Can be defined and called anywhere in the file.
- To define a function in Python you use the (df) keyword.

- Think of a function as a recipe. If we were preparing a meal we would:
    1. Specify ingredients (variables) needed for the meal.
    2. Use the actual ingredients (pass arguments) when starting (invoke a function).
    3. We follow the instructions step by step (function) for ingredients (parameters) and prepare them.
    4. Once the food is ready we serve it up to those that are eating. (return)

- The advantages of functions are reducing the duplication of code, breaking down complex problems into simpler pieces, and improving clarity of code.

SYNTAX
- The def keyword signifies the declaration of a function. This indicates that the following code is a function and assigns a name to that function, so we can call it later. Parameters are inputs the function is expecting and appear inside the parenthesis that follow the function name.

PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS 
- We define the input of functions using parameters. Functions can have parameters as we need, including 0.

RETURNING VALUES
- It is very important to remember the following: a function is equal to whatever that function returns.
