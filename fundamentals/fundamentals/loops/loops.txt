LOOPS

- If we want to iterate through numbers, we can use Python's range fuction. It can have between 1 and 3 arguments.

Range with 1 argument - range(5) -- stop
- Start: defaults to 0
- Stop: Exclusive of 1st
- Step: Defaults to 1

Range with 2 arguments - range(5,10) -- start, stop
- Start: Inclusive of 1st
- Stop: Exclusive of 2nd
- Step: Defaults to 1

Range with 3 arguments - range(5,10,2) -- start, stop, step
Start: Inclusive of 1st
Stop: Exclusive of 2nd
Step: Interates by 3rd

NOTE - if you need to specify an increment other than +1, all three arguments are required.
for x in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(x)
# output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
for x in range(5, 1, -3):
    print(x)
# output: 5, 2
