There are 3 basics types of numbers in Python.

- int - whole numbers, positive or negative.  ex. 35
- float - decimal numbers, positive or negative.  ex. 4.2
- complex - are a part of the real number system and are often referenced with the letter j.  ex. 1 + 3j.  **Note** If you're not sure if you need to use them, it's safe to say you can ignore this data type.
