What is the difference between mutable and immutable?
- Mutable objects (lists[]) allows you to modify its internal state after creation.
- Immutable objects (tuples()) disallows the ability to change the objects state after you created it.

Dictionaries
- Back in the day if you were to asl someone what a word meant you would look it up in the dictionary. 
- A "dictionary" in python is to be thought of as the same thing. It is a list of words and definitions of key/value pairs.
- Example: {'name': 'Melissa', 'job': 'Instructor'} - name being Melissa and definition of job being Instructor.

Loops
- The colon means "after me comes my instructions."
i.e
    x = 10
        if x < 5: <--
    print(True)
